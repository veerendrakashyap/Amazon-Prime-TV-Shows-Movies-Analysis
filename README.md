## 📚 **Project Summary**

This project is an in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of Amazon Prime’s TV shows and movies, aiming to uncover meaningful insights that can drive business decisions. By analyzing two datasets — one containing content metadata and the other detailing cast and crew information — we explore patterns in content type, genre distribution, ratings, runtime, release trends, and more.

The goal is to help Amazon Prime optimize content recommendations, enhance viewer satisfaction, and make data-driven decisions for content acquisition and production.
